# libft

This is where my searching character trait unfolded. First, I wanted to know how to do it right (I even wrote [article](https://github.com/zapisator/My-articles-at-_-42-_-forum/blob/master/libft_puzzles.md) about it: I revealed how functions depend on each other - implementing basic elements in the beginning I only combined and supplemented further. Secondly, I studied how it was written in the libraries before me, what suited me, in connection with the requirements of the format of the code and the essence of the task, and what does not. This is how I wrote [the second article](https://github.com/zapisator/My-articles-at-_-42-_-forum/blob/master/strlcat.md). I ran into the shortcomings of the assignment ([article](https://github.com/zapisator/My-articles-at-_-42-_-forum/blob/master/article_preparation/%D0%9E%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BA%D0%B8%20%D0%B2%20libft.odt)). The other articles were only looming. Because of a lot of thorough preparation, I often got into arguments at the defense. I was punished with low grades for this. They feared that my features would not pass the automated review at all: ". Only one cautious person noticed this and, fearing something, stepped on my proud heart with his foot..." (Maxim Gorky's "Danko"). So the score was not 125, but just over 100.
